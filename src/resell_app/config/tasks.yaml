image_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the product images using the Qwen Vision Tool to extract structured product information.
    
    STEP 1 - TOOL INVOCATION (ONE TIME ONLY):
    Call the Qwen Vision Tool EXACTLY ONCE with the image_urls from the context: {image_urls}
    Pass the image URLs as a list to the tool.
    
    STEP 2 - VALIDATE RESPONSE:
    - If the tool returns an error (e.g., "inconsistent images"), format that error as JSON and STOP
    - If the tool returns valid JSON with product details, proceed to Step 3
    
    STEP 3 - FORMAT & RETURN:
    Extract and structure the tool's response into the expected output format.
    Return ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no markdown, no additional text.
    
    **CRITICAL**: Call the tool only ONCE. Do not retry or loop. If it fails, return the error as-is.
    
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "item_name": "string",
      "brand": "string",
      "model": "string",
      "color": "string",
      "condition": "string",
      "key_features": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
    
    If analysis fails, return:
    {
      "error": "string"
    }
    
generate_query_task:
  description: >
    Generate an optimized German search query for Kleinanzeigen based on the image analysis results and iteration feedback.
    
    CONTEXT:
    - Current Iteration: {iteration}
    - Image Analysis: {image_analysis}
    - Previous Feedback: {feedback}
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. You MUST base your query ONLY on the image analysis provided above
    2. DO NOT hallucinate or add information not present in the image analysis
    3. The query MUST be in German (Kleinanzeigen is a German platform)
    4. Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations, no additional text
    
    GERMAN MARKET CONVENTIONS (CRITICAL):
    - Do NOT use technical model numbers (e.g., A2886) - German sellers list by marketing names (e.g., iPhone 14 Plus)
    - Translate color names to German (e.g., Midnight → Mitternacht, Silver → Silber, Blue → Blau)
    - Use German condition terms: New → neu, Like New → wie neu, Good → gut, Fair → befriedigend
    - Brand names stay in English if that's how sellers list them (e.g., Apple, iPhone, Canon)
    - Balance specificity with breadth: include color/condition only if likely to find matches
    
    QUERY STRATEGY BY ITERATION:
    
    Iteration 1 (Initial Query):
    - Start with Brand + Marketing Model Name (use item_name or model, not technical ID)
    - Keep it concise: 2-4 words maximum
    - Example: For iPhone 14 Plus (A2886) → "iPhone 14 Plus" (NOT "A2886")
    - Example: For Canon 5D Mark IV → "Canon 5D Mark IV" (NOT "EOS 5D Mark IV")
    - Example: For Jobo Multitank 1540 → "Jobo Multitank 1540"
    
    Iteration 2+ (Refinement based on feedback):
    - If feedback says "too broad" or "too many unrelated items":
      * Add color detail from image analysis (translated to German): "iPhone 14 Plus Mitternacht" (Midnight→Mitternacht)
      * Add condition if relevant: "iPhone 14 Plus neu" (New→neu)
      * Maximum 4 words after adding details
    
    - If feedback says "too narrow" or "no results":
      * Remove specific details: drop color or condition, keep brand+model
      * Example: "iPhone 14 Plus" instead of "iPhone 14 Plus neu Mitternacht"
      * Try broader term if available from image analysis
    
    - If feedback says "wrong focus" or "wrong product type":
      * Pivot to different attributes from image analysis
      * Use key_features if product type might be wrong
      * Try alternative German product categories
    
    COLOR TRANSLATION GUIDE:
    Common English → German: Midnight→Mitternacht, Silver→Silber, Gold→Gold, Black→Schwarz, 
    White→Weiß, Blue→Blau, Red→Rot, Green→Grün, Rose Gold→Roségold, Space Gray→Weltraumgrau
    
    VALIDATION:
    - Ensure no technical model numbers are included (A2886, EF-S, etc.)
    - Verify colors are in German if included
    - Confirm the query uses marketing names sellers would recognize
    - Double-check query is natural German that sellers would use
    - Verify you're outputting ONLY valid JSON
   
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with this exact structure:
    {
      "search_query": "string"
    }

evaluate_list_task:
  description: >
    You are a strict Quality Assurance Auditor for second-hand market listings.
    
    1. INPUT ANALYSIS:
       - Target Product: Read the "{image_analysis}" carefully. Note the Brand, Model, Material, and Color.
       - Listings: Review the JSON list in "Scraped Data".

    2. EVALUATION LOOP (Mental Scratchpad):
       For every single listing, perform this binary check:
       - MATCH (true): The listing is DEFINITELY the same product (same model/design). It can be used/second-hand, but must be the specific item we want.
       - NO MATCH (false): It is a different model, a "lookalike", a spare part, a box only, or a rental ad.
       
       *CRITICAL*: If the title says "Suche" (Searching for) or "Defekt" (Broken), mark it as is_match: false.

    3. EXECUTION STEP:
       - Read the scraped listings using "Read Local Database".
       - IMPORTANT: pass the file path from context as {scraped_data_file}.
         Example tool input: {"request":"read","file_path":"C:\\path\\to\\kleinanzeigen_items.json"}
       - Construct a list of evaluation objects. Each object must contain:
         { "id": "...", "price": "...", "is_match": boolean, "reasoning": "short reason" }
         - **DO NOT** calculate percentages or counts yourself.
         - **YOU MUST CALL** the tool "Evaluation Metrics Calculator" with this list.
       
    4. FINAL OUTPUT:
       - Your final answer must be the **exact JSON output provided by the tool**.
       - Do not add extra text, markdown, or explanations outside the JSON.

  expected_output: >
    Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown formatting (like ```json) or additional text.
    The JSON must match this exact structure:
    {
      "individual_results_evaluation": [
        {
          "id": "Listing ID",
          "price": "Price string (e.g., '150 €' or 'VB')",
          "is_match": true,
          "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why it matches or fails"
        }
      ],
      "count_positive": 0,
      "count_negative": 0,
      "match_percentage": 0.0,
      "total_listings": 0,
      "overall_sufficiency": "sufficient",
      "query_improvement_feedback": "Actionable feedback if insufficient (max 200 chars)"
